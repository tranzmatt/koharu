# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve Koharu. Contributions of every size are welcome, including bug fixes, documentation, translations, model-port corrections, and focused product improvements.

## Find a place to help

- Browse the [good first issues](https://github.com/koharu-rs/koharu/contribute).
- Search [open issues](https://github.com/koharu-rs/koharu/issues) and pull requests for related work.
- Ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mHvHkxGnUY) if you need help choosing an issue or narrowing the scope.

## Plan the change

Small bug fixes, documentation improvements, tests, and other focused changes can usually be submitted directly. Keep each pull request focused on one problem.

Before implementing a new product feature, significant UI change, new model or provider, platform integration, dependency, public API, schema change, or architectural refactor, open an issue and discuss the problem and proposed direction with the maintainers. We would rather discuss an idea early than have you spend time on work Koharu cannot sustainably adopt.

An open issue, feature request, or working implementation is not a promise that a change will be accepted. Agreement on a direction also does not guarantee that every implementation will be merged.

The README of an affected crate can provide useful context about that component's responsibilities.

## How features are evaluated

Maintainers consider:

- alignment with Koharu's product direction;
- value to users and whether the use case is sufficiently broad;
- effects on UX, architecture, performance, security, privacy, and platform support;
- testing, documentation, dependencies, and operational complexity;
- whether the maintainers can support the feature over the long term.

Maintainers may decline or postpone a feature, request a smaller scope, prefer another design, or suggest that it remain outside the core project. This is not a judgment of the effort put into the proposal.

Once a change is merged, its maintenance becomes the project's responsibility. A contributor's willingness to continue helping is valuable, but Koharu must still be able to own the feature if that availability changes.

## Follow Koharu's project rules

- Update every in-repository consumer when an API or schema changes instead of adding compatibility aliases.
- Keep provider-specific defaults and request behavior with the provider that owns them.
- Keep safe public APIs separate from unsafe FFI and dynamic-loading code.
- For upstream model ports, preserve checkpoint-affecting structure and compare structured outputs on identical inputs.
- Measure performance changes on the real target device with representative inputs, and report correctness alongside timing.
- Do not commit credentials, model weights, datasets, generated output, build artifacts, or machine-specific files.

Comments are most useful when they explain ownership, invariants, upstream mapping, or an intentional divergence.

## Check your work

Review the complete diff and run the smallest relevant debug-profile check or focused test once. Unrelated full test suites are not required. Format changed Rust and TypeScript files and run `git diff --check`.

Add change-specific evidence when relevant:

- screenshots for visible UI changes;
- the device, input, baseline, result, and correctness difference for performance work;
- structured output comparisons for model ports.

If a check cannot run in your environment, mention it in the pull request so reviewers know what remains unverified.

## Open a pull request

Explain the problem, the chosen solution, important behavior or ownership changes, and the checks you ran. Keep unrelated refactoring out of the pull request so the change remains easy to review.

Review is a conversation. Maintainers may suggest revisions or a smaller scope, and contributors are welcome to ask questions when feedback is unclear.

## AI-assisted contributions

AI tools may assist development or communication, but a human contributor must remain the author and owner of every submission.

If AI substantially helped design or implement a change, disclose the extent and purpose of that assistance in the pull request description. Routine code completion, grammar correction, and translation do not need detailed disclosure.

Do not submit autonomous or unreviewed issues, pull requests, review comments, or security reports. Before submitting, you must:

- personally review the complete diff;
- verify generated claims against the code and reproduce reported problems;
- understand and be able to explain every change and its important edge cases;
- be able to revise the implementation in response to review;
- provide the same relevant tests and evidence expected from any other contribution.

Treat generated output as a draft, not as evidence or a finished contribution. The substance of the pull request description and responses to maintainers must reflect your own understanding.

Maintainers may close a submission without detailed review when it appears unreviewed, contains speculative or fabricated claims, cannot be explained or revised by its contributor, or requires substantially more review effort than the value it offers. If you are unsure whether your use of an AI tool is appropriate, ask before submitting.

Next, set up the checkout with [Development setup](/development/setup/).
